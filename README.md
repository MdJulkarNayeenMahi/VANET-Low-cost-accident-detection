# VANET-Low-cost-accident-detection
Vanet Location descriptor without including GSM and GPRS:
The modeled system describes the detection ranges via computer usb nrf transcievers and computer to computer hop based localization , that finds the correct ranges of vehicles in geo locality based efficient routing manner, overcomes the main issue of GSM and GPRS repeaters. Still some furnising are needed and works are going on. This work got a prize from IIT-Kragpur , West-Bengal, India at a conference entitled IEEEtechSym2016 on Sep 29-31.
